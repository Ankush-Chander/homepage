Oftentimes when we are learning a new skill, we place on ourselves the expectation of an expert. A habitual expectation by virtue of fluency we have acquired in the previous skill. And result is frustrating.

It"s uncomfortable already to delve( yes delve!) into a different skill set, leaving the visible shores of a familiar territory. Unhealthy subconscious expectation adds further to it.

Same thing is experienced in sports training when you are adding a new trick in your bag. You say to yourself "I will spend 10 mins on it in today's practice" only to realise that you have barely made any progress in that time, to find out that it"s not as simple as it looked on Youtube.

What"s the remedy?
When learning a new thing, consciously free yourselves from **time-boxing**.

Tell yourself:
"I am new to this. I am going to take as long it takes me to 'get it' right and it will be worth it."
